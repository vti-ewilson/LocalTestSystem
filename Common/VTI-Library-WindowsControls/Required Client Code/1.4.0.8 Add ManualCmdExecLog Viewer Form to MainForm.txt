1. Double-click on your MainForm.cs file in Solution Explorer. This should display your MainForm in designer mode.
2. At the top of the form, in the menu strip, click on "View". At the bottom of the View menu, there should be an empty box with the text "Type Here".
3. In that box, type in "Manual Cmd Exec Log" (without quotes) and press enter to create the new ToolStripMenuItem.
4. Double-click on your new "Manual Cmd Exec Log" ToolStripMenuItem to create a click event, or alternatively:
	a. Right-click on your new "Manual Cmd Exec Log" ToolStripMenuItem and select "Properties".
	b. Make sure the name of your new ToolStripMenuItem is "manualCmdExecLogToolStripMenuItem" (without quotes).
	c. Make sure the text property is set to "Manual Cmd Exec Log" (without quotes).
	d. In the same properties window, click on the lightning bolt icon (Events button). 
	e. Double-click on the empty cell next to the "Click" event to create a click event.
5. Edit your click event to be:

	private void manualCmdExecLogToolStripMenuItem_Click(object sender, EventArgs e)
        {
            Machine.ManualCommands.ViewManualCmdExecLog();
        }
		
6. In your ManualCommands.cs, add:

	[ManualCommand("VIEW MANUAL CMD EXEC LOG", false, CommandPermissionType.CheckPermissionWithWarning)]
        public virtual void ViewManualCmdExecLog()
        {
            VTIWindowsControlLibrary.Classes.ClientForms.ManualCmdExecLog.Show();
        }
